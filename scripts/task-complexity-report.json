      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the project initialization into: Next.js setup, Vite integration, Tailwind CSS configuration, and verification of dark mode utilities.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves multiple tool integrations (Next.js, Vite, Tailwind) and custom configuration, but each step is well-documented and commonly performed in modern web projects. Complexity is moderate due to the need for correct interoperation and configuration."

      "expansionPrompt": "Expand into subtasks for: directory watching setup, CSV parsing logic, React context integration, error boundary implementation, and edge case testing.",
      "reasoning": "This task combines file system watching, data parsing, state management, and robust error handling. Each aspect introduces potential edge cases and integration challenges, raising overall complexity."

      "expansionPrompt": "Decompose into: table structure setup, virtualization integration, fixed header implementation, row click/expand logic, and performance testing.",
      "reasoning": "Building a performant, interactive table with virtualization and custom event handling is non-trivial, especially with large datasets and UI responsiveness requirements."

      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Split into: animation setup, panel structure, image gallery integration, and comment display logic.",
      "reasoning": "Requires animation, dynamic content rendering, and integration of additional features (gallery, comments), but is focused on a single UI component."

      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Expand into: virtualization integration, caching setup, loading skeletons, error fallback UI, and performance benchmarking.",
      "reasoning": "Optimization tasks require understanding of performance bottlenecks, integration of third-party libraries, and robust fallback mechanisms."
